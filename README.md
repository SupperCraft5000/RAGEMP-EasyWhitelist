# RAGEMP-EasyWhitelist
This is a basic whitelist system for your server. Just place it in the packages folder & it works!

## Installation
Just place the folder "easy-whitelist" in the packages folder. 

## How to add users to the whitelist
Go in the packages folder > then "easy-whitelist" > and edit the file account.json

There you have to add the SocialClub ID. Restart Server & its done.
